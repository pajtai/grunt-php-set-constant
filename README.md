grunt-php-set-constant
======================

## Description

Set a constant in a php file to the value indicated.

This is a multi task.

This supports single or double quotes. Heredoc and nowdoc within the `define` are not supported. String constants are
supported as are numbers, constants, and booleans. The quote marks will be maintained. So you can add quotes to
transform from and initial number to a string. But, currently, you cannot transform a string to a number, etc. Grunt
templates are supported in the config `value` field.

## Usage

Example usage within grunt init:

```javascript
    setPHPConstant: {
        stage: {
            constant    : 'ENV',
            value       : 'stage-<%= grunt.template.today("yyyy-mm-dd") %>',
            file        : 'temp/myfile.php'
        }
    }
```

The above would change the source of `temp/myfile.php`. It would change something like

```php
define('ENV', 'blah');
```

to

```php
define('ENV', 'staging');
```
